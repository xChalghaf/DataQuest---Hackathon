# DataQuest---Hackathon

Challenge 1 (Time Series):
This competition challenges participants to develop machine learning models that can accurately forecast water levels in dams in Tunisia over time. The dataset consists of historical water level data for multiple dams, along with weather data.

The goal of the competition is to accurately predict the water levels for each dam for the period from 06/02/2019 to 01/12/2020 , based on historical data. Participants will need to develop models that can accurately capture the complex relationships between the input data and the water levels, and make reliable predictions in real-world conditions.


Challenge 2 (NLP):
The challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify science and technology articles into different categories using their abstracts. The dataset consists of a large number of articles, each with a corresponding abstract and a label indicating the article's category. The categories include topics such as physics, computer science, statistics, and more.

Participants in the challenge will be provided with a training set of articles and their corresponding labels, which they can use to train their machine learning models. They will also be given a separate test set of articles without labels, which they will use to evaluate the performance of their models. The models will be judged based on their AUC ROC score on the test set.

The challenge is designed to encourage the development of accurate and efficient machine learning models for categorizing science and technology articles, which can have significant applications in fields such as academic research, science journalism, and content recommendation systems.
